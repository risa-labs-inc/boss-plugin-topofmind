/**
 * A Space: its panes, seen from a corner.
 *
 * `Icons.Outlined.SpaceDashboard` face on - a big pane beside two stacked ones - tipped onto an
 * isometric plane and given a little thickness. The division is the same one, because that is the
 * shape people learned; only the angle is new.
 *
 * **The geometry is one projection, written once.** `at(wx, wy)` maps the unit square a Space's
 * panes live in to the plate, and every point below is a call to it - so the three panes cannot
 * disagree about where the plate is, which is what happens when isometric points are typed out by
 * hand. The projection is the same one the Top of Mind floors view uses, and the host has a copy
 * of this file for its own Space button; see the note at the bottom.
 *
 * The plate and its divisions are STROKES, unlike most Material icons: the divisions are the
 * content here, and a filled plate would need a second colour to show them, which an `Icon` tint
 * cannot give it. The thickness underneath is a fill at low alpha, which costs no lines - see the
 * note on it, and the render that made the difference obvious.

// cannot import a host internal and the shared surface it COULD live in - `ai.rever.boss.plugin.ui`
// in the api jar - is served parent-first, so putting it there would need an api release and a
// `minApiVersion` gate for an icon. The two copies must be changed together; if a third consumer
// ever appears, that is the point at which the api release is worth it.
