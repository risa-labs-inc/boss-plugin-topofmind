/**
 * A Space: its panes, on a card that stands a little off the ground.
 *
 * `Icons.Outlined.SpaceDashboard`'s division - a big pane beside two stacked ones - drawn face on,
 * with a thin shade wrapping its bottom and right edges. The division is the same one, because
 * that is the shape people learned; the depth is a hint, not a projection.
 *
 * **The geometry is one projection, written once.** `at(wx, wy)` maps the unit square a Space's
 * panes live in to the card's face, and every point below is a call to it - so the three panes and
 * the shade under them cannot disagree about where the card is, which is what happens when the
 * corners are typed out by hand. The host has a copy of this file for its own Space button; see
 * the note at the bottom.
 *
 * **This was an isometric plate first, and the reason it is not one any more is worth keeping.**
 * The division used to be tipped onto the 2:1 plane the floors view draws. Reading it back, that is
 * too much staging for a 16dp button, and it cannot be dialled down: a plate has no face, so
 * shallowing the tip flattens the whole glyph towards a lozenge rather than making it less
 * isometric - at a fifth of the depth the panes are unreadable slivers. Depth had to come off a
 * card that faces the reader, which is what this is.
 *
 * Three things the renders settled, none of which was obvious on paper:
 *
 * - **The shade wraps the corner.** A band under the bottom edge alone - "thickness, no rotation",
 *   the most restrained version there is - reads as an underline under the card rather than as the
 *   card having a bottom, and leaves the glyph bottom-heavy. Turning it up the right edge as one
 *   L is what makes it read as a solid.
 * - **It goes down and right, never up.** The floors view puts a workspace's thin faces receding
 *   back-and-up off its front face, and copying that here fails: a dim band ABOVE the outline
 *   reads as a glow or a smudge, on a dark ground and on a light one, because the eye only takes
 *   an offset shade for depth when it falls where a shadow would.
 * - **It is a FILL, and it sits outside the stroke.** A fill costs no polylines and has no caps to
 *   grow spurs where they meet, which is what sank the first version of the isometric one (eight
 *   stroked lines in a 20px box, divisions closed into a blob). Starting the band at the stroke's
 *   OUTER edge rather than its centre line is what makes [LIFT] the thickness you actually see.
 *
 * The plate and its divisions stay STROKES, unlike most Material icons: the divisions are the
 * content here, and a filled card would need a second colour to show them, which an `Icon` tint
 * cannot give it.
 *
 * **Judged at 13dp to 20dp, which is every size it ships at.** The plugin's footer draws it at
 * 20dp and its tab menu smaller again; the host's Space button is a `BossActionButton` `leftIcon`,
 * which is 16dp, or 13dp compact. The empty state is the only large one, and large always looks
 * fine. [STROKE] is 1.6 rather than the 1.4 the tipped version used because at these sizes the
 * glyph sits in a row of Material outlined icons (Save, Delete, Search) whose strokes are 2 units,
 * and 1.4 read as a lighter class of thing beside them.
